# Solutions App Directory

The Solutions App Directory is an open resource that aims to capture and develop digital practice at Keele University by demonstrating how technologies are being used to engage students. Inspired by microlearning resources such as #1minuteCPD (Manchester Metropolitan University) and incorporating the 3e Framework (Edinburgh Napier University), the project addresses the overwhelming availability of technologies for learning and teaching, curating them in collaboration with educators who have adopted such tools. The app also categorises each technology, providing users with suggestions (or just-in-time solutions) based on pedagogical themes. 

All code and content is released under a Creative Commons licence and openly published via GitHub to encourage reuse, adoption and collaboration. 

For more information about the development of this project, please see our presentation from the OER18 conference at https://goo.gl/1W1GgE.
